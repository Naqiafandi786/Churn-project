# Churn-project
Telco Customer Churn Prediction -Python ML Project
# ðŸ“ž Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

An end-to-end *Machine Learning project* that predicts whether a telecom customer will *churn (leave the company)* or *stay* based on their demographics and service usage patterns.

---

## ðŸš€ Project Overview
Customer churn is a critical problem for telecom companies. This project helps identify customers likely to leave, allowing companies to take proactive retention actions.  

Built with *Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit*.

---

## ðŸ§© Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical data)
- Feature engineering (tenure groups, number of active services, average monthly charges)
- Model training with *Random Forest Classifier*
- Model evaluation using *Accuracy, ROC-AUC, and Confusion Matrix*
- Interactive *Streamlit web app* for live churn predictions
